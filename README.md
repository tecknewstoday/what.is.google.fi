It's now been a few years since Google first launched Project Fi, now called Google Fi. It first made an appearance in 2015, seeking to deal with some of the pain points of US carriers. 

When it launched it was only available to those using the Nexus 6, but has since been expanded. It's now available to not only Android device owners but also iPhone owners. The whole point of Fi is that it aims to give you the best cellular and data coverage wherever you are in the US, or indeed, the world.

Your service is still pulled from major 5G and 4G LTE networks, but your phone can smartly switch between them as you move around. It can also intelligently use Wi-Fi when available to make calls and send texts. 

If you're wondering whether Fi is right for you, this is the guide to read. We've explained what it is, how it works, what it costs, and more.

## What is Google Fi?

With a Google Fi plan, you'll get improved network coverage. Fi uses two carriers (T-Mobile - which has since bought Sprint - and US Cellular) and Wi-Fi hotspots if available to ensure you always have the most reliable connection wherever possible. You just need to use Fi with a smartphone that's either "designed" for Fi or "compatible" with Fi. This can be an unlocked Android, Pixel, or even an iPhone.

Beyond cellular and data coverage, Google Fi is all about streamlined billing. You pay one fee per month for unlimited talk and texting, plus a flat rate per gigabyte of data after that. There's also a level called "Bill Protection", which effectively caps your charges every month and therefore serves an unlimited plan. You can also do international data and calling with Fi, and there's no additional cost for data use or texting.
